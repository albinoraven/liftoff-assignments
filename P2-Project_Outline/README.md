## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Have you ever had a legal issue and thought, "I really would like to be able to do this myself without paying a lawyer so much!"  Well, the good news is, in a lot of areas, this is completely possible!
Welcome, to LegalEase.  A site where you can find statutory information about Adoption, Divorce, Bankruptcy, Traffic Law, Wills, Trusts, and Estates.  In addition to this, relevant recent court cases will be searchable for information pertaining to your specific situation.
Not only all of this, but if you have a traffic citation or misdemeanor charge, there will be a portal for both inputting and paying for an attorney to drop that charge so it doesn't affect your personal life since some things DO still need an attorney!
### Features
User Login: Create account and log in, though this will only matter if they are interested in receiving assistance with traffic tickets/misdemeanors.
Search: Search through tickets already submitted and track their progress in the court system.
Search: Within the site, a search bar attached to Google Scholar for court cases.
Payment Portal:  A way to pay by credit (or paypal?) for traffic tickets or misdemeanor charges.
### Technologies
C#
HTML
CSS
SQL
Whatever is needed to do the payment portal

### What I'll Have to Learn
I'll have to figure out how to connect google's search engines to an independent site.  In addition, I will have to figure out how to create a payment portal, whether that is through an established open source code and properly connecting it, or trying to muddle through myself.  
I'm somewhat certain I will end up having to learn Java or JavaScript, I'm worried C# won't be the best language to make this web app in.
